                        <p>The colours and brush strokes used by Van Gogh are a big inspiration for me, and I wanted to create a  portrait in his style using my dog as a subject.
                           The references used were a combination of Van Gogh's portraits, mainly for the outfit and painting style, and a real photo of my dog wearing glasses for the rest.
                           This was a really fun piece to work on and is something that I would like to do more of in the future.
