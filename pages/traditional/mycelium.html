                        <p>This project was an experiment in creating art out of mycelium as a way of creating more sustainable art. 
                           The mycelium grows into a compostable mixture which is formed into the desired shape. The result has a texture similar to polystyrene and is surprisingly strong and light.
                           It shows that there are new and interesting alternatives out there to plastic products. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I created two main projects from this: a whale rising out of a mycelium block, and a mycelium shield with a message about how mycelium could replace plastics to help save the planet from pollution.</p>
