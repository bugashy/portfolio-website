                        <p>This kingfisher is painted on a large piece of cardboard I had leftover from a delivery box. 
                           I wanted to create a piece on something other than paper, and liked how paint dried faster on cardboard.
                           This created a new challenge, as I had less time to wipe off paint or correct mistakes as they happened, and instead had to slow down and work with what I had.
                        </p>
