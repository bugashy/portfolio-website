                        <h2>STILL LIFE WITH PUMPKINS</h2>
                        <br>

                        <p>This piece was created as I wanted to practice sewing and had a piece of cloth that I didn't want to go to waste.
                           It was approaching Halloween, and I was inspired by pumpkins that I saw around me, especially "imperfect" ones that some shops sold.
                           I wanted to capture the different colours, shapes, sizes and textures in a more unique way, instead of just painting them.
                           The larger pumpkins are stuffed to create a more 3D effect, and buttons sewn on top add even more texture.
                           The piece as a whole was also inpsired by Paul Cézanne's still lifes. The cloth is arranged like a tablecloth on top of a canvas, as if the pumpkins are still life subjects to be painted.
                           Also pictured are the specific pumpkins I was inspired by.
