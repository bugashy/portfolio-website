                        <p>These skulls were drawn exclusively with pen stippling. I used a series of fineliners, as their size meant that each dot was smaller and therefore required more patience to shade an area.
                           This allowed me to slow down and focus on technique and details instead of trying to complete it as fast as possible.
                           I used cotton wool around the edges to create a more tactile piece, emphasizing the way that remains must decompose to leave behind the bones.
