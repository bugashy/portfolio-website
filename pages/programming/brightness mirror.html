                        <p>The <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNqaw8LT2ZU" target="_blank">brightness mirror</a> is a tutorial from The Coding Train that I followed when I was first looking into P5.js.
                           The brighter a pixel, the larger the shape representing it becomes, and I was interested in how I could use the effect produced to create unique photos of things around me. 
                           When the photo is made smaller, it becomes a lot easier to make out the subject of it. However, when bigger, it becomes a mass of dots that can be hard to identify. 
                           I edited the appearance slightly between photos by changing the colour, shapes, and shape size to experiment with different outputs.
