                        <p>Goose is a game that I created as an assessment piece during the first year of my course.
                           We were asked to demonstrate what we had learnt throughout the year by creating a top down adventure game that utilised JavaScript and the P5.js library.
                           I chose to create a game where the player is a goose who must collect keys to escape. There is a game camera implementation that allows the player to walk around a map and explore. NPCs and objects around the map can then be interacted with.
                           All of the assets in this game were drawn by me.
