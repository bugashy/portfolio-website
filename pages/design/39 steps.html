                        <p>I created this poster for my school's production of The 39 Steps. In the brief I was given the title, a plot summary, and information to include on the poster. 
                           Originally, there was just a solid black silhouette running across the page to represent the spy in the film.
                           I later added the grey streaks from the corner to create the feel that the character is on the run and under the spotlight, with the red on the person symbolising the danger that he is in.
