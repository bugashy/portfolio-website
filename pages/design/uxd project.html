                        <p>As part of a second year exam, I was tasked with redesigning the volunteer materials for use in a museum in York. Existing materials are a series of videos and a large, text-heavy document.
                            This involved user and market research to gather data about existing volunteer training materials and opinions on how effective they were.
                            In combination with the project requirements set out by the client, this research informed my design process which can be seen evolving through a series of wireframe designs. 
                            I wanted to focus on how I could structure a large amount of information in an accessible and intuitive way that doesn't put too much mental strain on the user.

                                <img loading = "lazy" src = "/assets/design/uxd project/wireframe.webp" alt = "A barebones wireframe of the program layout">
                                <img loading = "lazy" src = "/assets/design/uxd project/wireframe 2.webp" alt = "A wireframe with a bit more detail and colour">
                            </div>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            My final design is for a program that allows volunteers to click through information laid out in a panel on the left. A model is visible in the centre to show them what they are learning about, and information is displayed on the right.
                            User testing indicated that this is much more successful than existing training materials, as users found it much more engaging to work with.
                            I later implemented my solution as an interactive application.
