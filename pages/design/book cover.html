                        <p>As part of a series of online workshops at Norwich University of Arts I took part in, I was tasked with redesigning a book cover for either Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Alice in Wonderland. 
                           I started by jotting down what the books reminded me of, such as spirals and playing cards for Alice in Wonderland, and how this created a dreamlike feeling. 
                           Drawing out ideas led to me focusing in on the use of a hand and spirals which is seen in the final cover. As well as letting me practice my Adobe suite skills, this workshop was a really fun chance to practice a design workflow.
