                        <p>While learning Blender, I decided to begin modelling my bedroom as a way to practice skills that I had learnt. 
                           A tutorial was required for some of the more difficult models, such as replicating the fabric in the bedsheets.
                           However, many of them were done without any external help, as I wanted to challenge myself to do as much as possible with my own knowledge.
                           This was also a good chance for me to practice texturing, as many of the models use photos taken of the real objects in my room.
                        </p>
